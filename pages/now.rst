**Last updated:** January 7th, 2016

I've created this page to help me allocate the right amount of time and energy to what I need and want to do. I will update this page regularly. General information about me `below <#general>`_.

January 2016
============
January will be a month characterized by **Change**, as I come back from a 3-week vacation in Colombia with my family to simultaneously finish my project at the `Elkerliek hospital <http://www.elkerliek.nl/>`_ in Helmond and start my newest project at `Erasmus MC academic hospital <http://www.erasmusmc.nl/>`_ in Rotterdam. I will also use this time to reflect on where I want to lead my side projects.

Family
------
My wife and kids are staying two extra weeks in Colombia, coming back to The Netherlands towards the end of the month. I will be focused on getting the gang acclimated again to both the weather and the school/work rhythm. Plenty to do!

Day job
-------
At Elkerliek, I will be using the 1,5 day per week to nicely round off the project. My main goal is to finalize the transition from implementation (where I played a large role) to maintenance (where the hospital staff is fully at the bar).

At Erasmus, I will focus on getting the project started as fast and efficiently as possible. That includes:

* Meeting my team and all the [relevant] key players in the hospital
* Owning the list of interfaces, detecting where information might be missing
* Getting in touch and laying the basis for collaboration with the most important vendors
* Putting in place the structure for work (productivity system, weekly reporting strategy, etc.)

I'm happy and proud of the successful project that is about to end, and exited to start the new project!

Side projects
-------------
At this moment I have 2 principal side projects going on:

* Continuing my idea extraction efforts as part of `The Foundation <link://tag/the-foundation>`_ training
* Push harder on the promotion of `EmailMerge.cc <https://EmailMerge.cc/>`_

My head has also been spinning for a couple of months on two other projects:

* Creation of a course on automating computer work using `AutoHotkey <https://autohotkey.com/>`_
* Writing my first book, the Interface Project Manager's Guide (i.e. my day job)

I will most likely start taking action on the course creation after taking the class you'll read about in the next section. The book writing will have to wait for now.


Learning
--------
As mentioned in the previous section, I am still applying the concepts learned in The Foundation. I have yet to break my current ceiling, which is to get a valid idea extracted.

I will also use this month to figure out if the mastermind group I'm in can be saved. Regular attendance has dramatically dropped during the summer holidays, intents in the fall have not been met with success. I do believe in the concept more than ever, so maybe it's time to find another group?

With the new year comes the time to think about going forward. The recent post on Side Hustle Nation about `The 134 Best Udemy Courses for Entrepreneurs, Freelancers, and Side Hustlers <http://www.sidehustlenation.com/best-udemy-courses-for-entrepreneurs/>`_ crossed my path at the right time. And with most courses this week for $10, I'm going to pick a few to digest over the coming year. There's definitely going to be one on the [so meta] topic of creating a Udemy course, to get me started on the right foot with my course creation idea about AutoHotkey.

General
=======
I live with my wife and two boys (five *and a half* and two years old) in Den Bosch, The Netherlands. As a Frenchman married to a Colombian wife living in The Netherlands, we are a multicultural family and our sons grow up in this trilingual environment. So fun to see them progress and seamlessly switch between French, Spanish and Dutch!

Current main work occupation
----------------------------

I spend most of my work time as the `interface project leader <https://zorgpiloot.nl/>`_ in various hospitals during their |EMRabbr| implementation, taking care of the interfaces between their new EMR and all the other software packages in the hospital. Think:

* propagating patient demographics and admission/discharge/transfer from the EMR to the rest of the hospital
* sending lab results from the EMR to the lab software and getting the results back
* receiving financial information
* connecting to the various nationally-run systems for patient verification, insurance information, medication prescriptions
* lots of ad-hoc connections built over the years that need to be "ported" over to the new EMR

Past endeavors
--------------

Before starting my consulting company `Zorg Piloot <https://zorgpiloot.nl/>`_ in February 2015, I worked 6 years in the Dutch branch of `Epic <http://www.epic.com/>`_, one of the leading worldwide EMR vendors. I was part of the interface and conversion team there.

Over the years I've worked with the following hospitals in The Netherlands:

* `Radboudumc <https://www.radboudumc.nl/>`_ - Nijmegen
* `AMC <https://www.amc.nl/>`_ - Amsterdam
* `Vumc <http://www.vumc.nl/>`_ - Amsterdam
* `Amphia <https://www.amphia.nl/>`_ - Breda
* `SLAZ <http://www.sintlucasandreasziekenhuis.nl/>`_ - Amsterdam
* `OLVG <https://www.olvg.nl/>`_ - Amsterdam
* `Spaarne <http://www.spaarneziekenhuis.nl/>`_ - Hoofddorp
* `Elkerliek <http://www.elkerliek.nl/>`_ - Helmond

Before Epic, I worked for just under two years in Madrid, Spain as a web developer for the `Rentalia <http://rentalia.com/>`_ holiday rentals company.

Earlier life
------------

And even before that, in short and anti-chronological order:

* Obtained my Danish engineering degree in Aalborg, Denmark from `Aalborg University <http://www.en.aau.dk/>`_
* Obtained my French engineering degree in Paris, France from `ECE <http://www.ece.fr/school-of-engineering/>`_
* Been an intern at Let It Wave (now part of `Qualcomm <https://www.qualcomm.com/>`_) in Paris, France
* Been an intern at `Furuno <http://www.furuno.com/>`_ in Nishinomiya, Japan
* Been an intern at `Prime Vision <http://www.primevision.com/>`_ in Delft, The Netherlands
* Obtained my Scientific French Baccalaureat in Aix-en-Provence, France
* Lived until my 16th birthday in The Hague, The Netherlands
* Born in Vernon, France
