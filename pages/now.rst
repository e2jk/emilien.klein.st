I've created this page to help me allocate the right amount of time and energy to what I need and want to do. I will update this page regularly. General information `below <#general>`_.

January 2016
============
January will be a month of change, as I come back from a 3-week vacation with my family in Colombia to simultaneously finish my project at the `Elkerliek hospital <http://www.elkerliek.nl/>`_ in Helmond while starting my newest project at `Erasmus MC academic hospital <http://www.erasmusmc.nl/>`_ in Rotterdam.

Family
------
My wife and kids are staying two extra weeks in Colombia, coming back to The Netherlands towards the end of the month. I will be focused on getting the gang acclimated again to both the weather and the school/work rhythm. Plenty to do!

Day job

General
=======
I live with my wife and two boys (five *and a half* and two years old) in Den Bosch, The Netherlands. As a Frenchman married to a Colombian wife living in The Netherlands, we are a multicultural family and our sons grow up in this trilingual environment. So fun to see them progress and seamlessly switch between French, Spanish and Dutch!

I spend most of my work time as the `interface project leader <https://zorgpiloot.nl/>`_ in various hospitals during their |EMRabbr| implementation, taking care of the interfaces between their new |EMRabbr| and all the other software packages in the hospital. Think:

* propagating patient demographics and admission/discharge/transfer from the |EMRabbr| to the rest of the hospital
* sending lab results from the |EMRabbr| to the lab software and getting the results back
* receiving financial information
* connecting to the various nationally-run systems for patient verification, insurance information, medication prescriptions
* lots of ad-hoc connections built over the years that need to be "ported" over to the new |EMRabbr|

Before starting my own consulting company Zorg Piloot in February 2015, I worked 6 years in the Dutch branch of `Epic <http://www.epic.com/>`_, one of the leading worldwide |EMRabbr| vendors. I was part of the interface and conversion team there.

All in all, I've worked with the following hospitals:

* `Radboudumc <https://www.radboudumc.nl/>`_
* `AMC <https://www.amc.nl/>`_
* `Vumc <http://www.vumc.nl/>`_
* `Amphia <https://www.amphia.nl/>`_
* `SLAZ <http://www.sintlucasandreasziekenhuis.nl/>`_
* `OLVG <https://www.olvg.nl/>`_
* `Spaarne <http://www.spaarneziekenhuis.nl/>`_
* `Elkerliek <http://www.elkerliek.nl/>`_

Before Epic, I worked for almost two years in Madrid, Spain as a web developer for the `Rentalia <http://rentalia.com/>`_ holiday rentals company.

And even before that, in short and anti-chronological order:

* Obtained my Danish engineering degree in Aalborg, Denmark from `Aalborg University <http://www.en.aau.dk/>`_
* Obtained my French engineering degree in Paris, France from `ECE <http://www.ece.fr/school-of-engineering/>`_
* Been an intern at Let It Wave (now part of `Qualcomm <https://www.qualcomm.com/>`_) in Paris, France
* Been an intern at `Furuno <http://www.furuno.com/>`_ in Nishinomiya, Japan
* Been an intern at `Prime Vision <http://www.primevision.com/>`_ in Delft, The Netherlands
* Obtained my Scientific French Baccalaureat in Aix-en-Provence, France
* Lived until my 16th birthday in The Hague, The Netherlands
* Born in Vernon, France

*Inspired by the* `/now page movement <http://nownownow.com/>`_.
