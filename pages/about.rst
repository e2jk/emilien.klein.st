**Last updated:** January 7th, 2016

I live with my wife and two boys (five *and a half* and two years old) in Den Bosch, The Netherlands. As a Frenchman married to a Colombian wife living in The Netherlands, we are a multicultural family and our sons grow up in this trilingual environment. So fun to see them progress and seamlessly switch between French, Spanish and Dutch!

Check out :doc:`what I'm doing now <now>`.

Current main work occupation
============================

I spend most of my work time as the `interface project leader <https://zorgpiloot.nl/>`_ in various hospitals during their |EMRabbr| implementation, taking care of the interfaces between their new EMR and all the other software packages in the hospital. Think:

* propagating patient demographics and admission/discharge/transfer from the EMR to the rest of the hospital
* sending lab results from the EMR to the lab software and getting the results back
* receiving financial information
* connecting to the various nationally-run systems for patient verification, insurance information, medication prescriptions
* lots of ad-hoc connections built over the years that need to be "ported" over to the new EMR

Past endeavors
==============

Before starting my consulting company `Zorg Piloot <https://zorgpiloot.nl/>`_ in February 2015, I worked 6 years in the Dutch branch of `Epic <http://www.epic.com/>`_, one of the leading worldwide EMR vendors. I was part of the interface and conversion team there.

Over the years I've worked with the following hospitals in The Netherlands:

* `Radboudumc <https://www.radboudumc.nl/>`_ - Nijmegen
* `AMC <https://www.amc.nl/>`_ - Amsterdam
* `Vumc <http://www.vumc.nl/>`_ - Amsterdam
* `Amphia <https://www.amphia.nl/>`_ - Breda
* `SLAZ <http://www.sintlucasandreasziekenhuis.nl/>`_ - Amsterdam
* `OLVG <https://www.olvg.nl/>`_ - Amsterdam
* `Spaarne <http://www.spaarneziekenhuis.nl/>`_ - Hoofddorp
* `Elkerliek <http://www.elkerliek.nl/>`_ - Helmond

Before Epic, I worked for just under two years in Madrid, Spain as a web developer for the `Rentalia <http://rentalia.com/>`_ holiday rentals company.

Earlier life
============

And even before that, in short and anti-chronological order:

* Obtained my Danish engineering degree in Aalborg, Denmark from `Aalborg University <http://www.en.aau.dk/>`_
* Obtained my French engineering degree in Paris, France from `ECE <http://www.ece.fr/school-of-engineering/>`_
* Been an intern at Let It Wave (now part of `Qualcomm <https://www.qualcomm.com/>`_) in Paris, France
* Been an intern at `Furuno <http://www.furuno.com/>`_ in Nishinomiya, Japan
* Been an intern at `Prime Vision <http://www.primevision.com/>`_ in Delft, The Netherlands
* Obtained my Scientific French Baccalaureat in Aix-en-Provence, France
* Lived until my 16th birthday in The Hague, The Netherlands
* Born in Vernon, France
