Following the :doc:`Testing Client-Side Applications with Django <testing-client-side-applications-with-django>` webcast, a new `O'Reilly webcast <http://www.oreilly.com/webcasts/index.html>`_ was given on the topic of web development, this time focusing on `Flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_, the Python micro-framework.

I wasn't able to watch the webcast live, but I'll be looking at it now that `its recording <http://www.oreilly.com/pub/e/3260>`_ has been released.
