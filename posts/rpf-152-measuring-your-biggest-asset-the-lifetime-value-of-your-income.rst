A quick note to recommend episode 152 of the Radical Personal Finance podcast on `Measuring Your Biggest Asset: The Lifetime Value Of Your Income <http://radicalpersonalfinance.com/152-measuring-your-biggest-asset-the-lifetime-value-of-your-income/>`_, in which `Joshua Sheats <https://twitter.com/JoshuaSheats>`_ invites us to consider the expected value of your lifeâ€™s income, to realize that we're already rich.

The three primary levers to push are:

* The higher your starting income, the better.
* The higher the annual increase, the better.
* The more years of income, the better.
