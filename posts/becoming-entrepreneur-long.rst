.. TEASER_END

Starting a business is the most liberating act that you can undertake in your life.

I avoided selling to clients because it was uncomfortable, even though it was the most important thing to do.

Guiding principles:

* **Be helpful. Make something people want.**
  I hold a BA Honors (first class), an MSc (with distinction), and a PhD. It was humbling to realize that such things are largely irrelevant in business. What counts is one’s ability to be helpful and make something that people want.

* **Provide purpose.**
  I started the business with only a vague idea of what I was doing. I came to understand that my most important responsibility was to provide a defining purpose and a clear vision for the venture.

* **Learn by selling.**
  Although selling our services to potential customers was the last thing I wanted to do at first, I came to understand that it was the most important activity for my business.

* **Measure everything.**
  When I started my business, I was running from one emergency to the next. After my rethink, I adopted a very proactive approach to tracking and analysis.

* **Don’t spend it until you’ve got it.**
  I learned (the hard way) that spending money until you run out is not a good plan. Instead, I came to adopt the approach of funding the business from earnings.

* **Make yourself redundant.**
  I learned to stop increasing my responsibilities within the business and do the opposite: extract myself from workflows as much as possible.

* **Revenue is vanity and profit is sanity.**
  Instead of focusing on growth, I learned to focus on what matters for the health of the business: profit.

* **Act despite uncertainties.**
  I had to give myself permission to risk failure, in order to achieve something remarkable.

I realized that my education and upbringing had all been geared towards becoming a lifelong employee.

Chapter One: Breaking Free
==========================

Entrepreneurship is an opportunity to live a purposeful life, without regrets. It is the freest and most fulfilling way of life I know.

Most people have been trained to look to authority figures for rewards. They look to bosses to give them a promotion, just as they were trained as children to look to teachers for grades and to parents for approval. In contrast, an entrepreneur looks for reciprocation from customers, as equals, for value provided.

Children are natural entrepreneurs: they have a restless curiosity and creativity. Employees are not born; they are made by years of indoctrination.

Work takes up such a huge proportion of our time, energy, and life. It’s far too important to leave it to someone else to decide what your best work can be.

Chapter Two: Something People Want
==================================

Build Your Advantage: Here are the three important things to remember about preparing for entrepreneurship:

* Choose a venture for which you have great empathy for proposed customers. Ideally, be a customer yourself (“eat your own dog food”).
* Develop your industry knowledge by working in the industry, talking to people who understand it, and reading about it.
* Build your technical expertise by developing rare and valuable skills in your proposed area of business.

Potential customers do not issue exams that you can cram for in order to get their business. Nobody cares what school you went to or what degrees you have. What they care about is whether you are doing something that is helpful to them.

What counts for success is not so much your business idea (which will change over time) but rather your capability to execute it.

When you ask yourself what kind of business you should start, what you are really asking is, “What can I do that would be helpful to others?”

You need three core capabilities in order to provide value to customers:

* Customer Empathy

  One of the best ways to get good customer empathy is to be a customer yourself for whatever solution your business provides. This is known colloquially as “eating your own dog food.” It is helpful because you experience the same needs that your customers experience.

  Entrepreneurs who can’t be a customer for their own product rely on research and imagination as tools to develop customer empathy. This means getting as much understanding of your customers as possible in order to simulate within your own mind what it is like to be in their position.

  There are many ways of getting structured feedback from customers, from online questionnaires to in-person interviews.

* Industry Knowledge

  You can’t be helpful to your customers until you understand their circumstances.

  The best source of industry knowledge is previous work in the industry. This kind of knowledge is one of the most valuable things that you can get from any jobs that you have before starting your own business.

  It is beneficial to talk to as many people as you can about their work so that you can learn about what happens in their industry.

* Technical Expertise

  If you know how to do something differently or provide a service that is totally new, it can give you a huge business advantage.

  Acquiring technical expertise means becoming skilled at something that is both difficult and useful.

  It’s not about what you know, it’s about what you can do.

  The danger is that if you focus on technical issues without sufficient regard to customer empathy or industry knowledge, you will end up making improvements that nobody cares about.

Chapter Three: You Provide the Purpose
======================================

Here are the three most important things to remember about finding purpose in business:

* Your job as an entrepreneur is to be Chief Enthusiasm Inspirer for a purpose that others can rally to.
* If you choose a purpose for your business that you genuinely care about, it will keep you going during the hard times.
* Find a way to express your purpose as simply as possible, ideally in three words.

The essential element of every successful business is an entrepreneur with an inspiring purpose. The technical details of your business will change and develop throughout the life of the business, but your purpose remains consistent.

**Chief Enthusiasm Inspirer**: If a business is to succeed and prosper, its purpose must inspire enthusiasm in others. As an entrepreneur, you need to inspire enthusiasm so effectively that people are willing to risk money to fund your venture, to forgo other opportunities in order to work for you, and to vote with their wallets by paying money to buy what you offer.

You will only inspire enthusiasm if you can define a purpose for your business that other people can understand and support.

It is horribly depressing to work on something that you don’t care about. How many thousands of times do you tell others about what you do for a living?

**Expressing Your Purpose**: A vital skill for every entrepreneur is the ability to explain one’s purpose in a way that is easy to understand.

A mantra defines your business in literally three words.

Chapter Four: Learn by Selling
==============================

Here are the most important points to remember about selling:

* The main value of selling is that it is a learning process. It shapes your business by providing you with essential feedback about what works.
* Every entrepreneur needs this learning process in order to succeed, so it’s vital to start selling as soon as possible and devote significant time to it on an ongoing basis.
* Ignorance and prejudice surround the act of selling, but the reality is that principled selling is a mutually beneficial activity that nurtures relationships.

Principled selling is rooted in principled negotiation. Negotiation does not have to be a battle of wills: it can be a collaborative search for win-win outcomes using objective means.

`Getting to Yes <www.amazon.com/dp/B0051SDM5Q>`_ by Fisher and Ury is widely considered the best book on negotiation;

As soon as you become an entrepreneur, you’re in the selling business.

It’s important to learn to find satisfaction and fulfillment through selling as quickly as possible because if there’s no selling, then there’s no business, and you’ll have to pack up and go home.

Selling teaches you resilience because, as with everything in business, you experience so much failure. Attempting sales and failing teaches you to keep trying. You learn to focus on the results as a whole, not the outcome of an individual sale.

I had to set aside significant chunks of time to focus exclusively on new business generation. I blocked out my calendar every Tuesday and devoted that day entirely to generating new sales leads. That worked for me as I could get into the mindset and just sell all day. I would follow up and respond to e-mails during the rest of the week, but I devoted one entire day each week to generating new business. It was easier for me to get in the zone for a day, but other people find it helpful to spend a couple of hours selling every morning. They don’t look at e-mails; they close the door and make themselves otherwise unavailable. Whatever time you prefer, I suggest you devote a bare minimum of one and a half hours a day or one day a week solely to new business generation.

You can't know in advance what you might offer that will really evoke enthusiasm in your customers, but you can make judgment calls and you can experiment. To be effective, any experiment requires feedback from your customers. The best way to get feedback is to try to sell.

Chapter Five: The Unexamined Business Is Not Worth Building
===========================================================

Here are the most important points to remember about planning and tracking:

* A business plan can be a useful way to summarize your business’s purpose, the means by which you propose to make money, and the steps that you intend to take in order to reach a few easily understandable goals. Nonetheless, your business plan is just a guess that will change over time.
* Business tracking is more valuable than planning. It is the most important guide for all your activities. The information (or business intelligence) collected by tracking is the most valuable asset you have.
* In order to gather business intelligence, you need to build, maintain, and analyze databases concerning all aspects of your operation. This chapter has provided examples of data collection relating to marketing and sales activities.

As an employee, you don’t get a chance to acquire a strategic overview of the company you work for, so there is much less opportunity to understand how it works. You don’t get to think about the big picture much because you do not run the business—the business runs you. In contrast, when you start your own business, you can get the most comprehensive overview of the operation possible.

You need to be proactive about tracking and analyzing your business in order to understand exactly what is going on. Without a proactive approach to mapping out your business, you will be just as unaware of the big picture as most employees are.

Your business plan is your intended strategy, but the way that you allocate your time and resources is your actual, emergent strategy.

Your list of contacts is probably the most valuable resource in your business. Business opportunities don’t just float in the clouds; they are always attached to a person. It’s not only customers that matter; other vital business relationships include partners, affiliates, referral sources, suppliers, and so on.

In this way, we built up a picture of who was behind the growth of our business. We knew who was connecting us to potential sales, who brought the most work to us in the previous year and who gave us the most profitable projects. This allowed us to ensure that we devoted attention to the people who really deserved it.

Your emergent strategy (what you are really doing) trumps your planned strategy (what you think you are doing).

Chapter Six: The Best Funding There Is
======================================

Here are the three most important things to remember about funding:

* Self financing through revenue is by far the best financing there is. It keeps your business focused and maintains your freedom and independence. Whenever you are considering any investment into your business, the most useful question to ask is whether you can finance it through revenue. It may not be possible to rely on revenue alone (it wasn’t for me), but the benefits mean it’s certainly worth trying.
* Track your cash-flow position as far into the future as possible: it is your early warning system when it comes to financing.
* You probably do not need nearly as much financing as you think. You may even need to run out of money in order to achieve the psychological changes necessary for your growth as a business owner.

The best way to finance your business is through your own money—incrementally through sales income from the business itself, supplemented at the start by your own savings, if necessary. Funding yourself is better for your business focus, your autonomy as an entrepreneur, and your ultimate financial freedom.

The idea behind revenue-based self financing is to fund the initial period—before you can make big sales with your full product—by making little sales with your minimum viable product. Every business that will be useful in the long term has value of some kind to offer customers in the beginning. If you can start selling that value in a simple form as quickly as possible, you can use revenue to finance the growth of the business and develop a more complex offering as you go. Even if you intend to develop a capital-intensive business (for example, one that involves a lot of technology), you might be able to start a capital-light version 1.0 of the business that helps customers in the present, and then incrementally develop a capital-intensive version 2.0 as you go.

If you apply the approach of doing what people will pay for to financing, what you get is revenue financing. It keeps you focused on customer needs and on what will sell, which will inform you as to how to invest wisely in your own research and development (R&D).

Start tracking forward cash flow from day one. You need to know how much money will be coming in and going out each week, as far into the future as possible, taking into account all committed revenue and spending.

You can rank your customers in terms of their payment reliability, which will let you know about any customers who cause you more problems than they are worth.

Chapter Seven: Make Yourself Redundant
======================================

  If your business depends on you, you don’t own a business—you have a job. And it’s the worst job in the world because you’re working for a lunatic! Michael E. Gerber

Here are the three most important things to remember about making yourself redundant:

* Extracting yourself from day-to-day operations is essential to your own freedom as an entrepreneur. It is also what allows your business to scale.
* There are three steps to extracting yourself:

  - standardizing your product
  - creating procedures for all your operations
  - optimizing those procedures (for example, by using mechanization or automation whenever you see a repetitive process).
* Be careful not to waste time optimizing ultimately senseless activities. It’s better to eliminate an activity as soon as you realize that it is commercially unsustainable, rather than waiting until the market forces you to.

Employee conditioning trains you to keep yourself busy, not to be efficient.

A successful entrepreneur is a business owner, not a business doer.

Freedom comes from working on your business, not working in your business.

You may also want to sell your business one day. This is only possible if you can demonstrate to a buyer that you have created an operation which can survive without you.

Proceduralization is the key for quality control. The most basic procedure is simply a checklist of the minimum steps necessary to undertake a task properly.

Any time you notice a repetitive procedure, it’s a signal that you should try to mechanize or automate it.

In designing your business, it’s important to accept the fact that any employee or subcontractor may leave at any point.

The key to knowledge capture is avoiding a culture of “gurus” in your business. Just as you don’t want your daily operations to be dependent on you as business owner, you also don’t want your operations to be dependent on any single person. If a guru leaves and takes all their knowledge with them, then you have a real problem. You have to try to work out what on earth that person was doing and rebuild the capability without them.

For example, it’s important that any IT systems administrators record and share exactly how they are managing your IT systems. That way, if a sysadmin leaves, a new one can see what’s been done and can get a handle on everything quickly. To facilitate such transitions, we devoted many pages of our internal Wiki to describing our IT systems in depth.

  Peter Drucker said, “There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.”

Chapter Eight: Profit Is Sanity
===============================

Here are the three most important points to remember about profit:

* Every entrepreneur has to make the transition from the initial pursuit of growth to the conscious pursuit of profit.
* If you don’t adopt the profit motive, your expenses will rise to match or outpace your sales and you won’t make any money.
* Only by adopting rigorous tracking and analysis will you know where your profit comes from. You are unlikely to get to profitability unless you implement sufficient tracking to give you this information.

Many managers end up evaluating staff on the basis of criteria that have little relationship to the ultimate health of the business, like whether an employee is present in the office from nine to five.

This dysfunctional characteristic of the employee system is so well-known that economists have a term for it: the principal-agent problem.

Often growth is measured by expense metrics, such as the employee headcount. This is the most dangerous way of all to measure your success.

Vanity metrics: measures of growth, not profit.

A large headcount is considered impressive in corporate life. In contrast, managers are very rarely asked how profitable their business unit is.

the fact that profit is taxed creates a strong incentive to preempt taxes by investing any potential profit into company growth. Corporations grow big partly because the tax system fundamentally disincentivizes profitability and incentivizes growth. The tax system also incentivizes solo entrepreneurs to minimize profit. Your tax bill gets less onerous as you claim more expenses, which encourages you to push the maximum allowable expenses through the business. This can warp your strategy and lead you to lose sight of what is best for the business.

“Revenue is vanity and profit is sanity.”

Chapter Nine: JFDI
==================

  As Reid Hoffman has put it, if version 1.0 isn’t embarrassing to you, then you’re launching too late.

Just Fucking Do It. This is what the experience of entrepreneurship teaches us about life. Living is expressed in action, not contemplation. A thought that does not lead to action somewhere down the line is useless, except for the gratification it brings in the moment. It doesn’t get you anywhere.

The only way to be creative is to act. If you really take this knowledge on board, it frees you enormously. If you want to make anything, action is always better than inaction, no matter how imperfect you think the result is. Our conditioning has left us with the fear that starting a business is as risky as jumping off a cliff, but the biggest cliff is the one in your mind. Jump off the cliff and build your wings on the way down. It’s scary at first, but once you are airborne, it is a wonderful adventure.
