After listening to `episode 813 <http://www.entrepreneuronfire.com/podcast/aaronyoung/>`_ of the `Entrepreneur On Fire podcast <http://www.entrepreneuronfire.com/>`_, I have bought the book `The Science of Getting Rich  <http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1604598875/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1604598875&linkCode=as2&tag=entreprcom-20&linkId=NXY2ZTSMGYQTK52A>`_ by `Wallace D. Wattles <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallace_Wattles>`_ (published in 1910) and am taking the **30-day challenge** to read the following chapters EVERY day for 30-days:

- `4 - The First Principle in The Science of Getting Rich <https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Science_of_Getting_Rich/Chapter_4>`_
- `7 - Gratitude <https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Science_of_Getting_Rich/Chapter_7>`_
- `11 - Acting in the Certain Way <https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Science_of_Getting_Rich/Chapter_11>`_
- `14 - The Impression of Increase <https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Science_of_Getting_Rich/Chapter_14>`_

The book is rather short and can be read in just a couple of hours. :doc:`Chapter 17 <summary-of-the-science-of-getting-rich>` is a good summary of the book, which according to `Aaron Young <http://laughlinusa.com/>`_ "will change your life" ;)

**Will you join me in this challenge?**

I will start counting back to 0 days if I miss one day. As of **Wednesday, March 18** I've read the four chapters for **eleven** consecutive days.

Note: the book is freely (as in cost of 0) available on `Wikisource.org <https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Science_of_Getting_Rich>`_. You can also get it in the form of a (once again) freely downloadable audiobook on `Librivox <https://librivox.org/the-science-of-getting-rich-by-wallace-d-wattles/>`_. And to allow you to "read" the book while driving or partaking in actions that do not permit reading, I've concatenated the four relevant chapters into a single `OGG audio file <http://files.klein.st/scienceofgettingrich_4-7-11-14.ogg>`_. So no excuses!
