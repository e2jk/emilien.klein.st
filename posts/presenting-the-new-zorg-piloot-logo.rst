The logo was actually the 9th submitted in the `99 Designs contest <http://99d.me/c/dctp>`_ that I ran, out of a total of 160 submitted designs.

The designer is Alexandru Parvulescu from `Azanti <http://azanti.ro/>`_.

I've overall had a good experience with the 99Designs process. I will shortly start a new design for the cover of my first book. I would recommend it to you if you're looking for graphic design work, and using my `99 Designs affiliate link <http://99designs.refr.cc/6JSDPJD>`_ you'll get a free $99 upgrade.
