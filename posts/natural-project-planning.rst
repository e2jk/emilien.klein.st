Here are my notes from `The Voluntary Life podcast episode 186 <http://www.thevoluntarylife.com/2014/12/186-natural-project-planning.html>`_ on this topic. You can also `listen to that episode <http://podcasts.thevoluntarylife.com/TVL_E186_project_planning.mp3>`_ (20 mins).

Start with personal projects, to make that skill second nature.

Project: Outcome you want to reach that has more than one step to achieve it.

* Name the outcome

* Always know what the next action is

* Review it regularly

For more complex projects, use a template.

* Do a mindmap with the name of the project in the center and start making links.

* Then fill out a template with key questions:

  * What is the purpose and principles of the project?

    - This is being done because...

    - On purpose means...

    - The key standards to hold and making decisions and acting on this project are...

    - The rules that I'm using for this project are...

  * Mission, Vision and successful outcome, or "If this were totally successful...", or "The best possible wild success...", or "Done means..."

* Journal or write down everything you know about the project.

* Brainstorm, ask 50 questions about this project.

* Write down all component parts, milestones (key points).

* All with the end of documenting. Sequencing and workplan:

  * Sequencing: taking milestones and (sub-)components: what happens next. What can run in parallel, what is dependent on other steps.

  * Workplan: Scheduling what you do when

Make sure you keep it live. Review!
