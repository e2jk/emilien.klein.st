To Spanish speakers, I recommend watching this recording of a seminar given by Ken McElroy in Colombia 2012 about real estate. It summarize pretty well the core concepts that Robert Kiyosaki explains in his Rich Dad books (such as `Rich Dad, Poor Dad <TODO>`_ and `Cashflow Quadrant <TODO>`_).

I'm sure there are good equivalents in English, French or Dutch, but I haven't searched for them myself yet.

Do yourself a favor, and learn about these topics.
