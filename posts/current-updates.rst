I've joined the `/now page movement <http://nownownow.com/>`_ and created my own /now page for me to share about :doc:`what I'm doing now <now>`. The goal to update that page each month is to keep me focused and accountable on the stuff I want to achieve. If that interests you, great!

You can also go back in time and `read my previous /now entries <link://tag/now>`_.

And because I didn't have a more general page, that information can now also be found on the :doc:`about me <about-me>` page.
