There we are, we're open for business. In fact, I should say business\ **es**:

* `Zorg Piloot <https://zorgpiloot.nl/>`_: my consultancy company to help hospitals with their implementation, support and development of `HL7 interfaces <http://www.hl7.org/about/index.cfm>`_, and other Electronic Medical Record (EMR) related topics.

* `Mental Martial Arts <http://mentalmartialarts.nl/>`_: my coaching company to get professionals rid of most of their stress realted to personal organization. My techniques are freely adapted from `Getting Things Done <http://gettingthingsdone.com/>`_, `Total Workday Control <http://www.michaellinenberger.com/outlook-book.html>`_ and `Pomodoro Technique <http://pomodorotechnique.com/>`_.

I did the paperwork :doc:`last Thursday<were-open-well-almost>`, and started the week with a number of administrative tasks:

* getting a new cellphone number
* opening a bank account
* taking care of the various insurance and retirement administrative steps
* discussing various topics with my accountant
* buying a new computer
* reserving the domain names and putting up quick "Coming Soon" placeholders
* opening up Twitter (`1 <https://twitter.com/zorgpiloot>`_, `2 <https://twitter.com/mentalmartial>`_) and LinkedIn (`3 <https://www.linkedin.com/company/zorg-piloot>`_, `4 <https://www.linkedin.com/company/mental-martial-arts>`_) accounts
* setting up mailing lists with `MailChimp <http://mailchimp.com/>`_
* looking for a possible flexible workplace outside of home

There obviously much left to do, but I'm happy of these first few days. To be continued!
