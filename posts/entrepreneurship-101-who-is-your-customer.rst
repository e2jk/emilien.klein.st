Just around the new year, I have enrolled in the edX course `MITx: 15.390.1x Entrepreneurship 101: Who is your customer? <https://www.edx.org/course/entrepreneurship-101-who-customer-mitx-15-390-1x>`_.

It kind of slipped off my radar in the past 2 weeks, but it's now back in my focus and I plan to make good progress on it quickly. The estimated effort is around 4 hours per week, and the course lasts for 12 week, so I'd better get to it quickly to not accumulate too much backlog...

.. TEASER_END: Notes ahead!

I will be updating this post as I go along the course.

Introduction
============

Entrepreneurship Can Be Taught.

Early Quiz (NOT Graded)
-----------------------

"Our goal is to identify some misconceptions you may have about entrepreneurship and what it takes to create a successful business."

10/10: it quickly turned to "let's give some pretty bold (but false) statements".

We're going to embrace that pirate spirit, that pirate spirit inside of you, and we're going to add to it the execution skills of a Navy SEAL.

Learning Goals
--------------

See the world through the customer's eyes.

Here's what you'll learn to do in this course:

* Explore and analyze potential applications for your idea 
* Choose the most promising markets and estimate their size
* Develop a comprehensive, actionable understanding of the prospective customer

6 Myths of Entrepreneurship
---------------------------

1. Entrepreneurs are born, not made.
   Skills such as management, sales, and product consumption can be taught and learned.

2. Individuals start companies.
   Usually a diversified team of founders. Building your dream team with more founders equals a better chance of success.

3. Entrepreneurs are the smartest people in the room.
   They tend to focus on something that deeply fascinates them, and then go into hype-focused mode. Focus and dedication make for successful entrepreneurs.

4. All leaders are charismatic and their charisma is a key factor in success.
   More than charisma, successful entrepreneurs exhibit characteristics such as vision, systematic thinking, strong analytic skills, a blend of humility and ambition ("humbition") and outstanding, disciplined execution skills.

5. Entrepreneurs love risk.
   Most successful entrepreneurs don't enjoy gambling. Great entrepreneurs prefer intelligent risk-taking, removing as much risk as possible and only take calculated risks.

6. Entrepreneurs are undisciplined.
   Successful entrepreneurs must have extreme self-discipline because they have few resources, no reputation, and a very finite amount of time in which to succeed.
