Just around the new year, I have enrolled in the edX course `MITx: 15.390.1x Entrepreneurship 101: Who is your customer? <https://www.edx.org/course/entrepreneurship-101-who-customer-mitx-15-390-1x>`_.

It kind of slipped off my radar in the past 2 weeks, but it's now back in my focus and I plan to make good progress on it quickly. The estimated effort is around 4 hours per week, and the course lasts for 12 week, so I'd better get to it quickly to not accumulate too much backlog!
