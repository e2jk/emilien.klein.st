Just around the new year, I have enrolled in the edX course `MITx: 15.390.1x Entrepreneurship 101: Who is your customer? <https://www.edx.org/course/entrepreneurship-101-who-customer-mitx-15-390-1x>`_.

It kind of slipped off my radar in the past 2 weeks, but it's now back in my focus and I plan to make good progress on it quickly. The estimated effort is around 4 hours per week, and the course lasts for 12 week, so I'd better get to it quickly to not accumulate too much backlog...

I will be updating this post as I go along the course. Last update: 2015-02-20.

.. TEASER_END: Notes ahead!

Introduction
============

Entrepreneurship Can Be Taught.

Early Quiz
----------

"Our goal is to identify some misconceptions you may have about entrepreneurship and what it takes to create a successful business."

10/10: it quickly turned to "let's give some pretty bold (but false) statements".

We're going to embrace that pirate spirit, that pirate spirit inside of you, and we're going to add to it the execution skills of a Navy SEAL.

Learning Goals
--------------

See the world through the customer's eyes.

Here's what you'll learn to do in this course:

* Explore and analyze potential applications for your idea 
* Choose the most promising markets and estimate their size
* Develop a comprehensive, actionable understanding of the prospective customer

6 Myths of Entrepreneurship
---------------------------

1. Entrepreneurs are born, not made.

   Skills such as management, sales, and product consumption can be taught and learned.

2. Individuals start companies.

   Usually a diversified team of founders. Building your dream team with more founders equals a better chance of success.

3. Entrepreneurs are the smartest people in the room.

   They tend to focus on something that deeply fascinates them, and then go into hype-focused mode. Focus and dedication make for successful entrepreneurs.

4. All leaders are charismatic and their charisma is a key factor in success.

   More than charisma, successful entrepreneurs exhibit characteristics such as vision, systematic thinking, strong analytic skills, a blend of humility and ambition ("humbition") and outstanding, disciplined execution skills.

5. Entrepreneurs love risk.

   Most successful entrepreneurs don't enjoy gambling. Great entrepreneurs prefer intelligent risk-taking, removing as much risk as possible and only take calculated risks.

6. Entrepreneurs are undisciplined.

   Successful entrepreneurs must have extreme self-discipline because they have few resources, no reputation, and a very finite amount of time in which to succeed.

Wrap-Up
-------

1) **Articulate the idea**. Describe it. If you arenâ€™t sure how, focus on answering these questions:

   - **What** is the problem you want to solve
   - **Who** experiences that problem
   - **How** you want to solve that problem
   - **Why** this is a better solution

2) **Reach out to at least 10 people** who you think are potential users/customers for the idea.  Schedule time to meet with them or speak by phone.



Step 1: Market Segmentation
===========================

The Lamborghini Story
---------------------

You have set up a Lamborghini shop, a friend that owns a Volvo asks if you can repair her car. **You shouldn't**. If you want to have a business, you need a paying customer. But we need multiple paying customers. So we have to focus on getting a paying customer that's similar in nature  and deselect all these other people.

We're going to focus on a specific customer, or group of customers where they're all pretty similar. And then we're going to build the company back from them.
And we're going to do it with great focus, and deselect everything else and not get distracted.


What is market segmentation?
----------------------------
A systematic categorization of potential markets for your idea, a description of multiple groups of target customers, groups that are homogeneous and distinct.

Identify potential industries for your idea. Subdivide each industry into markets and market segments. List the people who might benefit from your idea in each industry, and ideally in each market segment. Focus first on end users, not customers. Your end user is a person who uses your product, your customer pays for it. Once you have identified the end users, describe the various tasks that they perform and how they would use your product. List the top six to twelve market segments that are most interesting. After that, your next step is primary market research. In other words, going and talk to some real people. Theory doesn't produce data, action does.

What to Do Next
---------------

- Interview prospective customers/end users for your idea (Try to interview at least 10)
- Begin conducting market segmentation



Step 2: Beachhead Market
========================

A beachhead market is the first market that you will choose to pursue. And it will give you the advantage and capabilities that you will use to pursue additional markets later on that will be as good or better than your first market.

Criteria for Selecting Your Beachhead Market
--------------------------------------------

7 questions to analyze very different and seemingly equally attractive market opportunities and then to take one amongst them:

1. Does your customer have the money to pay for your product?

2. Can you easily get the product to your customer? Is the customer accessible to you?

3. Does the target customer have a strong reason to buy your product?

4. Can you deliver the whole product?

5. Is there entrenched competition that could block you from getting this business?

6. If you win this market, we it help you win other segments as well? Is this a strategic market that will give you capability, credibility to win other markets that will be equally profitable or more profitable for you?

7. Is the market consistent with the values, passions, and goals of the founding team? Is this something that you're going to feel comfortable doing for the next six years? Are your personal financial goals something that you need to realize in a three-year time horizon? And the market that you're looking at might require 10 years to mature.

Key Measure of Success
----------------------

Being able to select a market and then to be disciplined and deselect other markets is key to success.

What if you choose the wrong beachhead market? If it's going to fail, fail quickly, eliminate that option, and focus on the other ones that are higher potential. Action will produce real data, and that data will tell you whether your beachhead market will or will not be viable.

Bigger Always Better?
---------------------

No. You want to find a market where you have the ability to totally dominate that market in a relatively short time period. And narrow focus markets is the best way to do this. You want to continue segmenting until your market opportunity matches the following three criteria that define a market:

1. The customers buy similar product.
2. The customers have a similar sales cycle.
3. There must be word of mouth between the customers in this market. If you get one, they tell other people in that market.

Key Lessons
-----------

* Lesson #1: The beachhead market is the market that you choose to attack and dominate first.  It serves as a platform for attacking follow-on markets.

* Lesson #2: Focus is vital.  In the beginning, your startup's scarce resources should be spent on attacking one market and one market only.  

* Lesson #3: Attacking your biggest market first isn't usually the wisest plan.
