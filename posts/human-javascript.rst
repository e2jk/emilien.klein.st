It's been a long time since I hadn't read a book in just 2 days. Granted, it's a relatively short one, but still: it was my introduction to SPA (Single Page Application) programming, and `Human JavaScript <http://read.humanjavascript.com/>`_ (yep, that's the book) by `@HenrikJoreteg <http://twitter.com/henrikjoreteg>`_ was an informative read.
It introduces the main concepts in `Ampersand.js <http://ampersandjs.com/>`_.

The book can be read for free on the web. I have created my own ebook to read on my Kindle, and will blog shortly on how I've done so.
