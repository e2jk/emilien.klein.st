This is the script I've loosely followed when making cold calls to reach out to the goat milk farmers in order to set up Idea Extraction calls as part of `The Foundation <https://thefoundation.com/>`_ process:

.. TEASER_END

(translation from Dutch, i.e. not a word-for-word translation of the actual words I'm using)


Good afternoon,

My name is Emiel Klein
<I use an adaptation of my first name, since Emilien is unusual for folks here, while they know folks that are called Emiel>

I am a [starting] entrepreneur [from Den Bosch], currently working on a project around milk producers.
<You can leave "starting" out. I use it for now to build up some sympathy with these business owners to remind them of how they started.It has worked fine for now, but it might back-fire if they get the feeling you don't know anything and will just waste their time. Use your judgment>
<Mention "from town name" if you're calling a business that is local to you, to build up some rapport>

Are you producing [cow/goat (make it animal-specific if you know it)] milk?

<PAUSE, let them answer>


<If Not producing milk>
My information must be incorrect, sorry for interupting. Have a nice day!


<If YES, producing milk>
I'm currently getting in touch with a number of [cow/goat (make it animal-specific, now that you know it)] farmers, in order to figure out what works fine for succesful milk producers, and also understand what works less well/challenges/issues that you are facing.

<PAUSE, answer any question they might have such as "Which university are you part of?">

I'd like to pick a date and time for a 20 or 30 minutes phone call with you, so that I can ask you a number of questions. Don't worry, I'm not trying to sell you anything, just understanding how things are going in your market.

<PAUSE>

<If interested, propose a day, if they're OK ask for morning of afternoon, then present a time>
Would this Wednesday work for you?
Is it better for you in the morning or the afternoon?
How about we set it at 2pm?
<Then thank them for setting up the call, greet them and mention you'll call back on said date>



<If not interested in setting up the call, try to figure out what the reason is, e.g.>
her: "we're too busy with the animals at this time with the nice weather"
me: "can I call you back when it rains"
her [confused]: "well, I guess so..."


<If really not interested, ask if you can contact them later on with the findings of your study. Even if they don't participate in the IE process, they might still become a customer later on?>
Can I inform you in the future on the outcome of my study, namely about how the problems that are faced by your peers can be solved?

<in any case, end the call on a good note, thank their for their time/energy, and don't end on a refusal, go ahead and call the next number on your list ;)>
