Tonight while doing the dishes, I was listening to `episode 618 <http://www.entrepreneuronfire.com/podcast/briantracy/>`_ of the Entrepreneur On Fire podcast, interviewing `Brian Tracy <http://www.briantracy.com/default.aspx>`_.

I just love this nugget of wisdom, at about 1:30 before the end of the episode, when John Lee Dumas asks Brian Tracy about his parting peace of guidance:

  Get going and keep going, and learn from every mistake, throw it over your shoulder.

  The one character of successful people is that they never fail, they simply have learning experiences.

That last quote is not strictly from Brian, as he mentions he got that from "a study". But as far as I'm concerned, I'll remember that as being his...
