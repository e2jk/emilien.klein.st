After having started my business more than :doc:`one year <come-in-were-open>` ago, I finally launched my `logo design contest on 99 Designs <http://99d.me/c/dctp>`_. The focus was on getting the first assignments running and not on having a nice logo, business card or website (`proof... <https://web.archive.org/web/20150317032925/http://zorgpiloot.nl/>`_), but I guess it's time now.

After just one day, I already have 17 submissions, of which 3 I'm really liking. There are 2,5 more days in the general submission phase, and then I'll start refining the submissions with the designers.

Keep posted for the final result!

I'll also need the logo to be on the cover of my upcoming book, I guess there's a second design coming up in the near future!
