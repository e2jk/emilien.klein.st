After having opened :doc:`my first webshop <ive-opened-my-first-webshop>`, I've now started my first affiliate program. It works like this:

* Affiliates `get in touch with me <https://emailmerge.cc/pages/affiliate-program>`_ and get a personalized discount/affiliate code.
* When somebody uses that specific code, they get 20% off the full price of the software
* The affiliate then gets to keep 50% of the amount paid by the customer

Depending on which product the customer chooses, the affiliate receives:

* $40 for the Enterprise version (full price $99,99, customer gets it for $79,99)
* $14 for the Pro version (full price $34,99, customer gets it for $27,99)

Don't hesitate: it costs you nothing and pays well, so `learn more about the program <https://emailmerge.cc/pages/affiliate-program>`_ and get your own affiliate code today!
