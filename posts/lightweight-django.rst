I've finished reading the `Lightweight Django <http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032502.do>`_ book by Julia Elman and Mark Lavin, which marks in a way my return to web development (more on this topic in February). I will most likely start working on a web application next month, and the concepts introduced in this book will come in handy:

* Creating a REST API using Django
* Using a client-side MVC framework to build a SPA (Single Page Application)

Coincidentally, a couple of days later an Oâ€™Reilly webcast was given by one of the co-authors of the book, Mark Lavin. As the title suggests, the `Testing Client-Side Applications with Django <http://www.oreilly.com/pub/e/3302>`_ webcast focused on the testing of a SPA written with `Backbone.js <http://backbonejs.org/>`_.

Speaking of SPA, have a look at the `SPA and the Single Page Myth <http://www.johnpapa.net/pageinspa/>`_ article by John Papa.

I'll have to investigate these SPA frameworks a bit more, for now the ones on my list are:

* `Backbone.js <http://backbonejs.org/>`_
* `AngularJS <https://angularjs.org/>`_ (I'm currently reading the `AngularJS: Up and Running <http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033486.do>`_ book)
* `Ampersand.js <http://ampersandjs.com/>`_ (I've also recently finished reading the :doc:`Human JavaScript <human-javascript>` book.

Happy web coding!
