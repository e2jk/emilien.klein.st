Pages I need to investigate later on to improve my VoIP setup:

* https://www.callcentric.com/ Free SIP account (if needed)
* http://www.ipkall.com/ Get a free US phone number
* http://www.callwithus.com/ Seems to be a nice VoIP provider (with API etc)

I found these links after reading this `Lifehacker <http://lifehacker.com/5726407/use-a-google-voice-number-from-outside-the-us>`_ article about using Google Voice outside of the US, which prompted me to think about my VoIP setup again (a project I'm thinking about for a long time already)

Next to that I want to find a cheap DID (Direct Inward Dialing) number in Colombia and in the Netherlands... The quest continues!
