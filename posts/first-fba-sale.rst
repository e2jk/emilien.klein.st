After some struggles to get our first shipment accepted into the Amazon warehouse, we got our first order on the day that the package was received!

It was a `Playmobil Muscle Bike <https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B00FJR0RNY>`_:

* We had bought it for 3,99 € for sale at Kruidvat
* Sending costs to Amazon were 1,3€ (we have cheaper options now)
* Sold it for 14,28 € on Amazon
* Amazon total costs 5,65 €
* Ending up with a payment of 8,63 €

A nice 63% return on investment, not too bad for our first intent.
