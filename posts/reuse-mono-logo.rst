Walking in the streets of `Pasto <http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=1.2146&lon=-77.2784&zoom=13&layers=M>`_, I stumbled upon this sports shop's logo:

Ever seen this logo anywhere? Let me help you:

.. image:: /assets/img/mono.png

Yes indeed, the logo of the `Mono Project <http://www.mono-project.com/>`_ ;)

By the way, for the non-Spanish speakers, the name of the shop is Primate. Mono in Spanish means monkey. See the similiarity here too?

For the legal people around here, I haven't checked under what license the Mono logo was released, no idea if this is a legit reuse or not...
