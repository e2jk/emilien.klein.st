Coincidence? Two days after having read the :doc:`Lightweight Django <lightweight-django>` book, one of its authors `Mark Lavin <http://mlavin.org/>`_ gave an `O'Reilly webcast <http://www.oreilly.com/webcasts/index.html>`_ on the topic of testing client-side applications with Django, going deeper into the testing aspect of the book.

The recording is `now available <http://www.oreilly.com/pub/e/3302>`_, have a look if you're interested in that topic (the site mentions "This presentation will be available to audience members until Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 03:00 PM Pacific Standard Time.")
