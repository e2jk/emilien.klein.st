These are the bugs I reported (or commented on) while testing Ubuntu 11.10 beta 1:

* `Narwhals visible in installation slideshow <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity-slideshow-ubuntu/+bug/843781>`_: Reported on 2011-09-07, Fix Released on 2011-09-18
* `Installation slideshow for 11.10 shows Evolution instead of Thunderbird as mail program <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity-slideshow-ubuntu/+bug/843834>`_: Reported on 2011-09-07, Fix Released on 2011-09-18
* Commented on `Installation failed in VmWare <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/743359/comments/13>`_: Not fixed until now (seems that unchecking "Download updates" and "extra codecs" enables to bypass this issue)
* `AssertionError when checking a ubiquity crash <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apport/+bug/843911>`_: Reported on 2011-09-07, Fix Released on 2011-09-14
* `Impossible to run ubuntu-bug when Ubiquity crashes <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/843933>`_: Reported on 2011-09-07, Fix Released on 2011-09-08
* `Error message not translated <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/843954>`_: Reported on 2011-09-07, Won't Fix on 2011-09-07: "Making the message not translatable was a deliberate decision due to the fact that bug reports should be in English only"

Overall, I'm really pleased with the quick reaction and fixes to the bug reports I created. It feels like it was a good idea to take the time to report those issues! I'm currently installing Beta 2, so let's see if I can find some other bugs to report!
