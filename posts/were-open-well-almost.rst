Today, I've been to the Kamer van Koophandel (Chamber of Commerce) and signed all the paperwork to open my new business!

The business' official start date is Monday, February 2nd 2015. I can't wait to take this new challenge on, but first on the planning is opening a bank account, buying a new computer, and reserving the domain names.

More to come :doc:`next week <come-in-were-open>`!
