My notes from the book by David Schwartz, `The Magic of Thinking Big <http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NGZIR92>`_.

**Create and follow a plan for self-development and growth.**

**Excusitis** - the failure disease

.. TEASER_END

Power of belief, 3 guides:

1. Think success, don't think failure.

2. You are better than you think you are.

3. The size of success is determined by the size of your belief.

All the excuses made by the mediocre fellow could be but aren't made by the successful person.

Knowledge is power only when put to use.

Attitude is more important than intelligence.

Action cures fear, inaction feeds fear.

We do not think in words or phrases. We think only in pictures/images.

See what can be, not just what is.

When you believe something is impossible, you'll find reasons why. But if you believe it can be done, you'll find ways to do it.

Impossible is a failure word.

"How can I improve the quality of my performance? How can I do better?"

Capacity is a state of mind.

Accept greater responsibility.

If you want it done, give it to a busy man.

Encourage others to talk to you.

Your physical exterior affects your mental interior.

Create a "sell-yourself-to-yourself" commercial.

Grow the "you-are-important" attitude.

Always give people more than they expect to get.

Don't be egotistical. Guard against the impression you know it all.

When thinking only good thoughts about people, greater success is guaranteed.

How you think when you lose determines how long it will be until you win.

Don't be a passivationist, be an activationist.

Use the mechanical way to accomplish chores. Just get started.

One fine way to prevent a war of words is to take a long pause before answering (e.g. 45 seconds).

We can turn setbacks into victories. Find the lesson, apply it, and then look back on defeat and smile.

A goal is a dream acted upon.

The important thing is not where you were or where you are, but where you want to get.

People are measured by the size of their dreams.

No one accomplishes more than he sets out to accomplish.

Progress is made one step at a time.

How to handle hard issues, e.g. quit smoking: resolve not to smoke for an hour, then repeat.

A diploma or degree may help you get a job, but it will not guarantee your progress on the job. Business is interested in competency, not diplomas.

Investment decision: "School - One night a week for life".

Think of the interests of people you want to influence.

Believe in - and push for - progress.

When you take over leadership of a group, they adjust to standards you set.

The successful person takes time out to confer with himself.

Set aside some time each day (minimum 30 minutes) to be completely by yourself.
