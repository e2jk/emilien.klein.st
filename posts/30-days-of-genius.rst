~~~~~~~~

There's a common misconception that artists have a monopoly on creativity. But the very act of making something - shooting a photograph, designing a product, thinking critically, or building a business - is a creative one. These small actions come from our unique inner impulse to create.

This is what Richard Branson, Jared Leto and Arianna Huffington have in common. This is what makes Brené Brown, Tim Ferriss and Mark Cuban successful. They're all world-class achievers, but more than anything, they've used their creative impulse as both fuel and compass. It has allowed them to push on when others haven't, overcome obstacles thought impossible, and build a life of habits that sustain their mindset. And they'll be the first to tell you that their accomplishments are built on learned skills available to anyone.

In this free video series, you'll learn about the big thinking and breakthroughs that allowed these geniuses to break the mold. They'll share their successes and failures, and turn them into actionable insights for you.
