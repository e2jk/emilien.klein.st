After having selected the goat milk farmers as my first market, and getting a list of the businesses in that area, I had phone numbers but no email addresses. This meant jumping right into cold calling farmers to set up Idea Extraction calls.

.. TEASER_END

Although this seemed very frightening at first, I was really suprised and pleased to find out that this method of approach was very succesful: I wrote the following bits after having made only 9 cold calls, but the proportion holds for the about 30 cold calls I've made in total:

  As I don't have email addresses for my market, but "just" phone numbers, I did 9 cold calls yesterday, and got 3 IE calls scheduled for tomorrow and Friday!

  Of those 9 calls:

  - 2 didn't pick up (will try again another day)

  - 1 was an incorrect phone number (makes for a funny "No, we don't have goats here..." ;) )

  - 2 didn't produce milk (one farm camping, the other only has horses)

  - only one was a "rejection" (her: "we're too busy with the animals at this time with the nice weather", me: "can I call you back when it rains", her [confused]: "well, I guess so...") (edited)

  After 45 minutes and having called 7 numbers, I was ready to take a break and get back to my dayjob's tasks, but I thought "a real entrepreneur pushes harder", so I called 2 more numbers. And both lead to scheduling IE calls. It pays to persist!

  I had made my first 2 calls on Saturday, 1 wrong number and 1 IE call scheduled.

  That makes for a 36% success rate (and even 80% success rate [4 out of 5] if you only count folks that picked up the phone and are in my market, i.e. actually producing milk). I'm really pleased, and surprised, by that number.

You can read :doc:`the script <cold-call-script-to-set-up-an-ie-call>` I've used on these first cold calls.

Now pick up the phone and start calling!
