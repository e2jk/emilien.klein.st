These are the seven highlights of `this video <https://thefoundation.com/blog/community>`_ from The Foundation:

1. Clearly written Why
2. `20 mile march <http://www.artofmanliness.com/2013/01/06/whats-your-20-mile-march/>`_, one hour of action per day
3. Skill of reflection
4. Accountability
5. Abundant mindset, giving more than you take
6. Figure out the how later, make commitment and say yes
7. Reach out for help

I'm each day more interested in applying to `The Foundation <https://thefoundation.com/apply>`_...
